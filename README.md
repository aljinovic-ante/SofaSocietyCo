**Requirements**<br>
Node.js ≥ 20<br>
Yarn ≥ 3.5 for Medusa, Yarn v1 for Storefront<br>
Docker & Docker Compose<br>

**Quickstart**

**Project evaluation**  
This was my first time working with the Medusa platform.<br>
At times, it was quite challenging to understand the Medusa Admin UI and the way it handles data and requests - especially during the user authentication phase and the order placement process.<br>
Both of these issues were eventually solved successfully. I would say that, as expected, the more time I spent working with Medusa, the better I understood it.<br>
I still have some work to do, such as integrating automated email services for sending password reset links, order receipts, and other similar notifications.<br>
I managed to send an automated email successfully, but I haven’t yet implemented all related features.<br>
Then, of course, there’s always some polishing to do and potential bugs to fix.<br>
The total development time is estimated at around 30–35 hours.
